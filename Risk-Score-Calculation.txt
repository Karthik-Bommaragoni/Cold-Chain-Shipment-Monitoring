Risk Score Calculation

Per Sensor Risk:
Low: No violations (score: 0.0–0.3).
Medium: 1–2 violations or sustained minor violations (score: 0.3–0.6).
High: >2 violations, critical violations (e.g., shock + temperature), or missing data (score: 0.6–1.0).

Overall Risk Score:
Weighted average of sensor risk scores (weights: temperature=0.4, shock=0.3, humidity=0.15, GPS=0.1, battery=0.05).
Example: If T100=0.6, X5=0.3, H200=0.6, S50=1.0, G12=0.0, B10=0.0:
           Score = (0.40.6 + 0.40.3 + 0.150.6 + 0.31.0 + 0.10.0 + 0.050.0) = 0.68 (High).
