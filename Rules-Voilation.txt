Rules and Voilation Logic

Sensor Rules
The system supports the following sensors with predefined threshold rules:

Sensor                Type                 Min Threshold   Max Threshold   Unit   Violation Type
ThermoProbe T-100     Core Temperature     2.0             8.0             °C     Temperature Spike
TempTrack X5          Surface Temperature  2.0             8.0             °C     Temperature Spike
HumidSensor H-200     Relative Humidity    40.0            60.0            %      Humidity Out of Range
ShockLog S-50         Shock                0.0             5.0             g      Shock Detected
GPS ColdTrack G-12    Route Deviation      0.0             500.0           m      Route Deviation
BatteryMonitor B-10   Battery Voltage      2.5             3.3             V      Low Battery

Violation Detection Logic
Threshold Violations:For each reading, compare the value against the sensor’s min_threshold and max_threshold.
If value < min_threshold or value > max_threshold, log a violation.

Sustained Violations:For temperature and humidity, flag a violation if readings exceed thresholds for 3 consecutive measurements (e.g., 15 minutes at 5-minute intervals).

Spike Detection:For ThermoProbe T-100 and TempTrack X5, detect rapid changes (e.g., >2°C change between consecutive readings).

Correlation-Based Violations:If a shock event (ShockLog S-50 > 5g) occurs simultaneously with a temperature spike, escalate to a critical alert.

Missing Data:If no reading is received for a sensor within 10 minutes, flag a “Missing Data” violation.

Data Consistency:Handle missing readings by interpolating values (linear interpolation) for summary statistics.
Flag delayed readings (timestamp older than expected) as potential issues.
